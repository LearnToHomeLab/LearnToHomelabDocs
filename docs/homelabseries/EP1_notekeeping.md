# Note taking, Obsidian Note Taking and Install 

Obsidian is a notetaking and knowledge management software designed to help users organize, connect, and develop their ideas. It is based on the concept of a "personal knowledge base" (PKB) and utilizes a method known as "markdown" for formatting text.

As our video explained, Note-taking is a critical tool and a skill you must master. No one likes paperwork, but proper documentation easily makes up almost half of IT roles, **not to mention there will be A LOT of times you forget something and wish youâ€™d made a note. **

The last step in the troubleshooting methodology is to document the solution. It is described as "Document the troubleshooting process, including the problem description, steps taken, root cause, and solution implemented. This documentation can be a reference for future troubleshooting efforts and knowledge sharing." You will become a master of the troubleshooting methodology as time goes on; one thing to keep in mind is that the symptoms do not always characterize the root cause of your issue.
