## Required Items:
The Proxmox machine being used in this guide: [N95 mini pc](https://amzn.to/49Ul82n) (I highly recommend you go with something that has 16gb of RAM or more) Servers are RAM heavy, the more you have the better!.
Recommended: [Beelink Mini PC SER5](https://amzn.to/3vdgbTe)
Alternative: [Beelink U59 dual ethernet](https://amzn.to/3PloqUa)

- [x] Proxmox Appliance (some type of PC that you are okay with running 24/7)

- [x] USB thumb Drive
## Downloading Proxmox (bootable USB):
The start of the tutorial:
Go to Proxmox.com and download the latest ISO installer [here](https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads). 
Note: copy the SHA256SUM to a .txt file to compare against in a later step.

Copy and paste the location of the file into the same .txt document.

</a>
Use the following command with your respective version of Proxmox to validate the integrity of the file against their good known hash.
EXAMPLE:
```
certUtil -hashfile C:\Users\learn\Downloads\proxmox-ve_8.1-2.iso SHA256
```
Use:
```
certUtil -hashfile (your file path here) SHA256
```

Now open etcher (was previously downloaded in EP 1 how to install OPNsense or PFsense firewall). You can also download etcher from [here](https://etcher.balena.io/#download-etcher).

## Installing Proxmox on Server/Mini PC

After that has completed, plug the USB device into your mini pc/server/SBC, whatever you are going to use to as your virtualization host **WHILE IT IS TURNED OFF**. Then turn the device on while continuously clicking your delete key until the BIOS appears.

Use your arrow keys and move over to the boot tab, under boot option #1 select the USB device with Proxmox on it.

Now allow for your device to boot, you will see the Proxmox graphical user interface (GUI) appear. Follow the install instructions, it is very basic, time zone, password, where you want to install to, etc. **!STOP ON THE LAST PAGE WHERE IT SAYS ISNTALLATION SUCCESSFUL!** read the next step.

When you get to the last step as seen below, when you select **reboot** you need to remove the USB device right after or it will take you back to the installation wizard.

Now we have successfully installed Proxmox, go to your web browser and go to the IP address listed from your Proxmox device. In our case the IP is 192.168.1.50.216:8006.
<a href="/images/EP3_proxmox/p15.png" class="image-expand">
