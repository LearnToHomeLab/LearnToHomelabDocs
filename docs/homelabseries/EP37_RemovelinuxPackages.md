This section is super quick and basic, but you should definitely know about it. Bloat software or unattended packages can have vulnerabilities in them, which can lead to opportunities for malicious hackers to find them, exploit them, and gain access to your system.

On a Debian server, removing unnecessary packages can be done using the apt package manager. You can use apt remove to uninstall a package, and apt purge to uninstall a package and remove its configuration files as well. For automatically identifying and removing unused packages, apt autoremove can be used, and de-orphan can help find and remove orphaned packages.

```
sudo apt autoremove
sudo apt autoclean
sudo apt clean
```
